# Olympic Games

This is a historical dataset of the modern Olympic Games, including all games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. This data was collected from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018.

Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year until 1992. After that, they were arranged so that the Winter Games occur on a four-year cycle starting in 1994, then the Summer Games in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is assuming that the Summer and Winter Games were always in alternating order.
